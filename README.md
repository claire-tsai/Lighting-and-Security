# Smart Stove Konb Application
We designed this product for **aging society**. Most of the old in Taiwan live alone because their children work in the city. some of them forget that they are cooking while watching TV, chating, etc. So we designed this smart stove knob to turn off the stove when detecting smoke or the user leave more than three minutes. We aim to reduce the harm from the stove.
